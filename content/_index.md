Welcome to the <u>first and only LPI-affiliated Pauper League in Germany</u>! After a successful first season last winter with an average of 26 players, we are now taking the next logical step: double up for the upcoming second season! 

Therefore, we'd like to proudly announce that next season of **Lega Pauper Lipsia** will happen from **June 2024 to January 2025** over **8 matchdays** with a capacity of **up to 64 players**!

## League Information

As an officially **[LPI-affiliated league](https://www.legapauperitalia.it/home)**, our league directly participates in the global pauper tournament scene and is  allocated **two byes** for the **Paupergeddon Winter 2026** which you can earn by either **accumulating the most points** over the course of the league or by **winning the Top 8** that happens at the end of the season. Please visit **Standings** for a daily updated overview of you points. Importantly, only **6 out of the 8 stages count towards your final score**! By winning a stage, you furthermore **will be handed a trophy**, which in turn can be used as an **entry ticket for the playoffs**.
