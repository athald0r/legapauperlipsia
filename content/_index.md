Welcome to Leipzig's Pauper League! We are the <u>first and only league</u> in Germany that is officially affiliated with the **[Lega Pauper Italia](https://www.legapauperitalia.it/home)** and therefore directly connected to the Paupergeddon tournaments as well as Pauper players all over Europe. After a successful inaugural season last winter with an average of 26 players, we are now taking the next logical step: doubling up for the upcoming second season! 

## League Information

We're proud to announce that the next season of **Lega Pauper Lipsia** will run from **June 2025 to January 2026** over **8 matchdays**, with a capacity of **up to 64 players**! As an official **[LPI-affiliated league](https://www.legapauperitalia.it/home)**, we participate in the global Pauper tournament scene and will most likely be allocated **two Byes** for the **Paupergeddon Winter 2026**. These Byes can be earned by either **accumulating the most points** over the course of the league or by **winning the Top 8** at the end of the season. Please visit the **Standings page** for a daily updated overview of your points. Importantly, only **6 out of the 8 stages count toward your final score**! By winning a stage you **will also receive a trophy**, which can be used as an **entry ticket for the playoffs**. For an always-updated version of our rules, please head over to the **[Rules section]({{< ref "/rules/" >}})**.
