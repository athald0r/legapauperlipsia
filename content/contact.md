We, the open Leipzig Magic group Pauper to the People have been playing Pauper and other formats together regularly for almost 10 years. We are united by the desire for a society without oppression and in our goal to create a supportive gaming environment where everyone feels comfortable, no matter who you are or how long you've been playing Magic.
