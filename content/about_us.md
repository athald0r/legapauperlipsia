+++

We, the open Leipzig Magic group **Pauper to the People**, have been playing Pauper and other formats together on a regular basis for almost 10 years. What started as a group of friends trying out a budget friendly competitive Magic format has now become one of the **biggest community driven Magic projects in Europe**! This includes social Pauper evenings, internal prereleases, organised meetings for newer players and of course our great Pauper league.

We want to play in an atmosphere where **everyone feels comfortable**, no matter where you come from, who you are, or how long you have been playing Magic. This requires everyone to treat each other with **respect and solidarity**, which is what we want from all participants. We are united in our desire for a **society without oppression and in our goal to create a supportive gaming environment** where everyone feels comfortable, no matter who you are or how long you've been playing Magic.
